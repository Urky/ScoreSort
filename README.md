# ScoreSort

A simple mod that orders the score at the end of a battle and makes it a little more readable.

# Features

- Per formation a score entry with their stats on top 
- Followed by the heroes of the party
- Followed by the troops ordered by kills

# Constraints

- Top icons do not support clicks, which means ordering by clicking them is not possible
